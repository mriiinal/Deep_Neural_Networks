# Deep Neural Networks
This repository contains Pytorch files that implement Basic Neural Networks for different datasets. <br>
It includes various codes that implement variational autoencoder and generative adversial networks, along with implementation of some milestone papers in the field of Neural Networks, Reimannian Geometry and making use of this geometry along with Neural Networks to solve Computer Vision Problems.

Our work borrows motivation from the following papers : 
1) <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05908">Tutorial on VAE's</a>
2) <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08014">Riemannian Geometry of Deep Generative Model</a>
